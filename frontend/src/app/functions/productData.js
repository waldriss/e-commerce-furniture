        "desc": "The symmetrical contours are visually light and harmonious. The Lin-Jan Simwool and the trend force of the sphere, the infinity image, fill in the design of the metaphorical meaning. Minimal metal artifact is painted in Latin colour. The spherical shape of the record ensures the uniform distribution of the luminous flux, and the mat glass makes it soft, comfortable for the observer.",

        "desc": "The chloe combines the traditional design elements and the innovative approach in the decor, it produces a bright, eclectic image, worthy of both classical and modern interers. The metal artifact of the lighter is coloured by French gold, and the actual glass plates are covering the light sources. Some of them are also carried out in the shade of French gold, which highlights the status and luxury of the model. Relef petals recall the fancy florist design that has been actuated in recent years.",
